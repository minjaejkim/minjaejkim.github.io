How do we explain, evaluate, and learn from other peopleâ€™s behavior? How are these processes supported by mentalizing and affected by motivation? My research multiple approaches (behavioral, neuroimaging, developmental, computational) to understand causal attribution and dynamic impression formation.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Dept. of Psychological & Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. I received a PhD in Psychology & Neuroscience from Boston College, and a BA in Neuroscience from Swarthmore College.

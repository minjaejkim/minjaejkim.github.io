How do we explain, evaluate, and learn from other peopleâ€™s behaviors? How are these processes supported by mentalizing and affected by motivation? My research uses multiple approaches (behavioral, neuroimaging, developmental, computational) to understand impression updating and causal attribution. 

I am currently an NSF SBE Postdoctoral Fellow in the Dept. of Psychological & Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. I received my PhD in Psychology & Neuroscience from Boston College, and my BA in Neuroscience from Swarthmore College.

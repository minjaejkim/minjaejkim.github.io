I am an NSF SBE Postdoctoral Fellow in the Dept. of Psychological & Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. I'm interested in how we learn about people from their actions â€“ how do we explain, evaluate, and draw inferences from behavior? How are these processes supported by mentalizing and affected by motivation? My research uses multiple approaches (behavioral, neuroimaging, developmental, computational) to understand dynamic social learning and causal attribution. 

 I received my PhD in Psychology & Neuroscience from Boston College, and my BA in Neuroscience from Swarthmore College.
